# DFP: Accessibility Map
If you have access to this, you know what this is for.  
This is our accessibility map **prototype** - we are not making a full product.  

## Contributing
To contribute, please:
1. Use `git` to copy the **`devel` branch** - this is where any changes are made.
2. Make commits with sensible, short and concise messages.

## Running
Currently, there is no app to run, so this section will be left incomplete.  

## The Code
The **back-end** is written in Python. You will find the code in `.py` files. To run a single file, use `python file.py`.  
The **front-end** is written in HTML, CSS and JS. These are in `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files respectively. **Please do not use `.htm` for HTML.**  
The **configuration** is written in YAML. These are in `.yaml` files. Like HTML, **please do not use `.yml` for YAML.**
